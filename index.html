		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>As a graduate student specializing in Information Systems and Management in IT, I am enthusiastic about developing my career in the IT field. My time at HDFC Bank provided me with exposure to various aspects of technology and management, including Project Management, Business Development, Cloud Computing, Network and Security, AI, and more. My experience of working in a team with colleagues from diverse cultures and opinions taught me how to be an effective team member, which has been valuable in various group projects during my Masters' course. I have also been involved in multiple work projects such as Algosec, Centralized Authentication Platform, Cloud Landing Zone, PwC Network Architecture review, Securonix SIEM, which have helped me develop a strong foundation in IT and management, preparing me for a successful career in this field.</p>

<p>Inspired by Mr. Sundar Pichai's career, I am excited to pursue a career in the IT industry. I believe that an internship will provide me with a platform to work on new ideas and gain experience in a variety of domains. I am particularly interested in various IT-related fields, such as Data Analysis, Marketing Analytics, Business Analysis, Network and Security, Cloud Computing, and other relevant roles. Additionally, I am open to exploring opportunities in tech-pre sales or managerial positions, such as Project Management, Product Management, or Technical Program Management. Domains like Supply Chain, e-commerce, Technology, Finance, Operations, Merchandising, Outside Sales & Services, Marketing, etc. sound interesting to me, and I would be excited to contribute to the vision of any organization in these areas.</p>

<p>I am eager to demonstrate my skills and passion for the IT industry and to contribute to the success of the organization. Learning Salesforce CRM has been an additional pursuit of mine, and I would be excited to apply my knowledge in this area during an internship.</p>
